# Calculator — Python Lab Mini-Project

A small Python project focused on practicing **core arithmetic operations, input handling, and basic validation**. This branch is part of the `python-lab` repository and serves as a learning sandbox for experimenting with Python logic and problem-solving.

## Purpose

The goal of this mini-project is to:

* Implement fundamental arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division
* Practice input handling for integers and floats
* Explore basic error handling and feedback for invalid inputs
* Build habits of writing, running, and refining code in Python

This project is **not** a production-ready calculator. It exists purely for learning and experimentation.

## Highlights

* Core arithmetic functions implemented
* Input validation with basic error messages
* Unit tests included for core operations

## Scope

* Integer and float operations
* Simple user input handling
* Error messages for invalid entries


## Usage

The user should ensure they are on the `calculator` branch, run the calculator script, and follow the on-screen prompts to enter numbers and select operations.

## Notes

This branch is designed for **hands-on learning**, repetition, and testing Python fundamentals in isolation. Each mini-project in the repository is isolated in its own branch to allow focused experimentation without affecting other learning tracks.
