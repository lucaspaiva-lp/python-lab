# Python Lab

A personal learning repository focused on **practical Python development** through small, incremental projects.

This repository serves as a sandbox to practice core Python concepts, reinforce programming logic, and build confidence by solving problems hands-on. Each mini-project is isolated in its own branch to allow focused experimentation and versioning without cluttering the workspace.

---

## Purpose

The main goals of this repository are to:

* Develop solid **programming logic** using Python
* Practice problem-solving through repetition and variation
* Strengthen understanding of Python fundamentals in isolation
* Build habits of writing, running, debugging, and refining code
* Progress from simple scripts to slightly more structured programs

This is **not** a showcase repository. It is a learning workspace. Branches are used to separate mini-projects for clarity and experimentation.

---
## Branches

Each mini-project is organized in its own branch to maintain isolation and clear progression:

* [`calculator`](https://github.com/lucaspaiva-lp/python-lab/tree/calculator) — arithmetic operations, input handling, and basic validation

---

## Scope

Projects in this repository intentionally focus on:

* Core Python syntax
* Control flow (conditionals, loops)
* Functions and decomposition
* Data structures (lists, dictionaries, sets)
* Basic state management
* Error handling and edge cases

At early stages, projects avoid:

* Frameworks
* Databases
* Complex architectures
* Overengineering

Structure and organization are introduced gradually as learning progresses. Branches allow isolated development of different concepts and mini-projects.

---

## Project Characteristics

* Small scope
* Single responsibility
* Executable scripts
* Emphasis on clarity over cleverness
* Refactoring happens after correctness
* Isolated experimentation per branch
* Versioning via Git tags for key milestones

Some projects may appear simple or repetitive by design — repetition is intentional to reinforce learning and logic development.

---

## Evolution

As proficiency increases, later exercises may introduce:

* Basic modularization
* Simple folder-based separation of concerns
* Light architectural patterns (when justified)

Tags can be used within branches to mark stable versions or milestones.

---

## Guidelines for Workflow

* Keep each mini-project isolated in its branch
* Commit frequently to capture progress
* Use descriptive commit messages, e.g., `chore(calculator): add input validation`
* Use tags for marking important versions, e.g., `calculator-v0.1`
* Avoid merging unrelated mini-projects into the same branch

Code quality, style, and solutions may vary across projects, reflecting different stages of learning and experimentation.
