# Python Lab

A personal learning repository focused on **practical Python development** through small, incremental projects.

This repository is designed as a sandbox to practice core Python concepts, reinforce programming logic, and build confidence by solving problems through hands-on experimentation.

---

## Purpose

The main goals of this repository are to:

* Develop solid **programming logic** using Python
* Practice problem-solving through repetition and variation
* Strengthen understanding of Python fundamentals in isolation
* Build habits of writing, running, debugging, and refining code
* Progress from simple scripts to slightly more structured programs

This is **not** a showcase repository.

It is a learning workspace.

---

## Scope

The projects in this repository intentionally focus on:

* Core Python syntax
* Control flow (conditionals, loops)
* Functions and decomposition
* Data structures (lists, dictionaries, sets)
* Basic state management
* Error handling and edge cases

At early stages, projects avoid:

* Frameworks
* Databases
* Complex architectures
* Overengineering

Structure and organization are introduced gradually as learning progresses.

---

## Project Characteristics

* Small scope
* Single responsibility
* Executable scripts
* Emphasis on clarity over cleverness
* Refactoring happens after correctness

Some projects may appear simple or repetitive by design — repetition is intentional.

---

## Evolution

As proficiency increases, later exercises may introduce:

* Basic modularization
* Simple folder-based separation of concerns
* Light architectural patterns (when justified)

The repository evolves together with learning progress.

## Disclaimer

Code quality, style, and solutions may vary across projects, reflecting different stages of learning and experimentation.
